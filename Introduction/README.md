## Introduction to the System

This project focuses on analyzing and designing the logic for an Online Book Shopping System. The rapid growth of information technology and the internet has significantly transformed the way people purchase goods, including books. Traditional physical bookstores can require plenty of time and effort to visit and can be restricted by location and working hours, but online buying platforms give greater flexibility and convenience (Laudon & Traver, 2020)

The system also enables the user to browse through the available books and even purchase them through the web interface system. It is also easy for customers to access various categories of books such as academic books, novels, and reference books without visiting the store. This makes online shopping systems more attractive to customers as opposed to the past (Turban et al., 2018).

In view of the administrators or owners of the stores, this system is helpful for efficient management of book listings and client data to ensure a smooth online functioning. The main purpose of this system is to ensure simplified overall book procurement for the client while facilitating efficient management on the back end of the system despite some complexity in the admin tasks (Pressman & Maxim, 2020).


## Background and Purpose


This project's main goal is to analyze and logically develop an online book shopping system. Increased internet connectivity and quick developments in information and communication technology (ICT) have had a big impact on how consumers buy goods and services. Because of this, online book purchasing platforms have become more and more popular as a practical and effective substitute for conventional bookstore shopping, which frequently necessitates customers to physically visit stores and is limited by geography and working hours (Laudon & Traver, 2020).

In view of the contemporary education system and the rising popularity of online shopping, this model is greatly beneficial to students, lecturers, and the general public who seek convenient and effective access to books. It is savvy to acknowledge that online shopping systems provide opportunities to access textbooks, reference books, and others without any form of delay (Turban et al., 2018).

A system-thinking approach would enable the Online Book Shopping System to be broken down into a number of interrelated sub-systems such as the registration sub-system, the search sub-system, the order sub-system, the payment sub-system, and the approval sub-system. This is because a system-thinking approach promotes a systematic flow of a system as well as a positive user experience (Pressman & Maxim, 2020).
